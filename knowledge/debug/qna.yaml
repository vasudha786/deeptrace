    Metrics Agent Issue, where the metrics agent is not running successfuly 
    The ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager pod is part of the IBM OpenShift Container Storage (OCS) operator. 
    It manages the lifecycle of storage resources like Ceph and NooBaa by reconciling custom resources such as StorageCluster. 
    This pod ensures proper provisioning, health monitoring, and updates of storage components. It also integrates with IBM metering 
    and licensing systems. Initial check should be ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager pod to be in running state
    After this ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager is working, we should ensure metrics-agent is working fine. The metrics-agent pod 
    is part of IBM Cloud monitoring and telemetry infrastructure. It collects and sends cluster and workload metrics 
    (such as CPU, memory, storage usage) to IBM Cloud services. This pod helps enable observability features like dashboards, alerts, and usage metering. 
    It typically runs as a DaemonSet to ensure metrics are collected from every node.
  questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the first question to ask?
        answer: |
          Is the ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager pod running in the kube-system namespace?
      - question: |
          If the ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager pod is running successfully, what is the next question?
        answer: |
          Do the logs of the ibm-ocs-operator-controller-manager pod show any errors related to the metrics-agent
      - question: |
          If there is any error in the pod logs 
        answer: |
          Do the logs of any ibm-storage-metrics-agent pod show connection errors, telemetry issues, or failed metric pushes

    The minimum configuration for a basic OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) deployment on IBM Cloud requires at least 3 worker nodes, 
    each with 16 CPUs and 64 GB RAM that is 16x64

    check for cephcluster and storagecluster status where 
    The Ceph Storage Cluster is the foundation for all Ceph deployments. Based upon RADOS , Ceph Storage Clusters consist of several types of daemons: 
    a Ceph OSD Daemon (OSD) stores data as objects on a storage node. a Ceph Monitor (MON) maintains a master copy of the cluster map.
